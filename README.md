1. This is a minimal example for the DART crawling.
2. I assume that you know how to use the API system of DART. Hence, you know the building blocks of URL of DART document, such as `rcp_no.' If not, please read http://dart.fss.or.kr/dsap001/guide.do and documents about API carefully.
I also assume that you know the `regular expression.'
3. In the `input` directory, ``rcp_no.csv'' contains the parameter value `rcp_no' for three arbitrary IPOs, which is collected by using the API system of DART.
